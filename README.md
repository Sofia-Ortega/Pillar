# File Structure

Directories:

- screens
- components

## screens

Kinda like a "web page". Contains all the React Native different "states" that you could be in.

Example of Potential screens: Landing, Schedule, Contact

## components

Reusable React Native components. For example, if you make a pretty button, that can be used in other parts of the app, put it in here

## assets

Contains images, or global data.
